#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderId

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(C.acctnum), avg(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers C
ON FS.orderID = C.order_id
WHERE FS.Quantity > 2

-- 8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
